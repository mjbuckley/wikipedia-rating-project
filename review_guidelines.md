# A Guide to Reviews

An article review contains two parts: the rating itself and your ‘comment’ on the particular edit of the article. Ratings are explained at length below; comments should be short paragraphs (less than 100 words in most cases) explaining your rating and areas for improvement.  If the problems or misperceptions of an article demand lengthier exposition, feel free to provide a link to an external blog post.

Please note that Wikipedia articles are in a constant state of change and revision. Try to make your comments complete and accurate, but save your deathless prose for some other venue; your comments will go out of date, and perhaps quickly. (Hopefully, they will go out of date because the article is improved in accordance your comments.)

### What to Rate

Your ratings should relate exclusively to the content of the Wikipedia article in question. Prose style, organization, etc. in Wikipedia articles are often worthy of improvement, but this is not the place to critique them. (After all, if you’re tempted to critique the prose style or organization of an article, why not jump in and edit it yourself?)

### Mind the Edit

Because Wikipedia articles are constantly changing, it is folly to provide a rating for the changing version of a particular article. (Insert obligatory Heraclitus reference here…) When you submit a rating, it is linked instead to a particular, stable revision of that article. (For example, note the difference between the unstable and stable versions of the ‘Middle Ages’ article.) If you’re comfortable with tracking down the ID number for the version you’re looking at, feel free to insert it yourself. If you leave the edit field blank, we will automatically provide your rating with a stable link to the most recent version of that Wikipedia article, as of the time of your rating. We also provide you, dear rater, with a link to that version of the article, so that you can check whether the article has changed as you’ve been writing up your rating. Checking this link is not obligatory, but it’s encouraged.

Why do it this way? Why link to an out-of-date version of a living document, when your comments will eventually become stale and go out of date? The main reason is that Wikipedia articles do not uniformly get better or simply improve over time (though some do). Our site allows teachers, librarians, and lay readers to draw on the highest-rated revisions of a particular article. We hope to make Wikipedia more usable for users who are looking for the best, most reliable Wikipedia experience– and not just the newest.

### A Note about Original Research

Please note, however, that Wikipedia’s standards of sourcing require that articles draw exclusively on published scholarship. This is a mistake, and good scholarship in most fields requires deep engagement with the relevant source materials. If you are a specialist on a particular subject, feel free to discuss the ways in which the published scholarship fails to accurately represent a subject or particular body of evidence.


## Rating Guidelines

### A
These articles are complete and up to date. They reflect current scholarly understanding of a particular subject, including the most recent and best scholarship published (see the note on original research below about scholarship). These articles are free of both major and minor errors, including misconceptions. You should feel no reservations recommending these articles to librarians, your students, or lay readers looking for treatment of a subject. This is the gold standard; use it sparingly.

### B
These are good articles; they are on the way to being high quality articles. These articles are free from major misconceptions and errors, though minor misconceptions and errors may persist. They draw most heavily on the best sources, such as monographs and journal articles for historical subjects. An article of this level has clearly been influenced by some recent scholarship on a subject, but may fail to reflect the most recent or best scholarship.

#### C
These articles are problematic. Coverage may be very inadequate, or they may represent reading in outdated secondary literature from decades ago (or even longer), may contain misconceptions from popular or unspecialized secondary literature or textbooks.

### Start
These articles have more content than stubs, but where coverage still remains partial and inadequate. Articles drawn from the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica (or comparable, out-of-copyright works) or poor quality, free internet resources with little revision or improvement are ‘start’ articles. In Wikipedia’s definition, this is “an article that is developing, but which is quite incomplete and, most notably, lacks adequate reliable sources.”

### Stub
A very short article that needs significantly more content to adequately cover its subject. If you’re thinking of assigning this rating, why not work to expand the article itself?
