# The Wikipedia Rating Project

### *Providing the tools for subject area experts to quickly and easily rate the reliability and accuracy of Wikipedia articles.*

Wikipedia is a phenomenal resource, but articles can sometimes be out-of-date and ill-informed, contributing to Wikipedia can sometimes be slow, frustrating work, and suggested revisions can encounter strong resistance from other contributors.

The Wikipedia Rating Project aims to improve the quality of Wikipedia articles by providing an easy way for subject area experts to provide ratings of Wikipedia articles. These ratings serve two functions: first, they allow the editors of Wikipedia to see what experts think of their articles, and hopefully to improve them; second, these ratings will allow readers of Wikipedia to find reliable Wikipedia articles.

Rather than serving as centralized location for these reviews, the Wikipedia Rating Project is a set of tools to enable communities of subject matter experts to easily create, oversee, and moderate their own sites.


## How it works

The Wikipedia Rating Project works by building on top of the WordPress platform.  The project consists of a plugin and theme that are added to a WordPress site to create a fully functioning reviews site.  WordPress sites are relatively simple to set up, inexpensive to host, and easy for non-technical contributors to understand.  The plugin and theme install in a matter of second and require very little set up.  Download links and more detailed information on the individual components can be found on the site links below.

## FAQ

### Is there an example of a site in action?

The [Medieval Wikipedia Rating Project](http://www.medievlawikipedia.org) was the impetus for the Wikipedia Rating Project, and it is built with the Wikipedia Rating Project Plugin and Theme.

### Why shouldnâ€™t I just edit Wikipedia itself?

Frankly, you should be editing Wikipedia articles. There are many Wikipedia articles that are short or incomplete that could be greatly improved by the attention of experts. But many articles have deeper problems, resting on misconceptions or outdated scholarship. The improvement of these articles is much harder than the expansion of short or incomplete articles. The Wikipedia Rating Project provides a way to offer feedback to readers and contributors to Wikipedia without the problems and considerable time investment of editing Wikipedia directly.

### Why bother rating Wikipedia articles if they are constantly changing?

Two reasons. The first reason is that by rating Wikipedia articles, you allow readers to track the quality of Wikipedia articles, and help Wikipedia contributors to improve these articles. We hope that tracking the quality of Wikipedia articles over time will encourage contributors to improve these articles.

The second reason is that by gathering ratings of Wikipedia articles, we are able to see which articles (and which revisions) are of the highest quality. As the Wikipedia Rating Project matures, we will compile a list of the best revisions of Wikipedia articles as a resource for those (like librarians, students, and interested readers) looking for reliable versions of Wikipedia articles.

### Why would I want to participate in the Wikipedia Rating Project?

The main reason to participate in the Wikipedia Rating Project is to help improve the quality of articles on Wikipedia. Wikipedia has a massive readership. Improving the accuracy of Wikipedia articles, even more than popular writing in books and periodicals, can help to publicize the findings of specialized scholarship and have a massive impact on the public understanding.

Furthermore, many faculty members have noted the ways that Wikipedia can be used in the classroom. The Wikipedia Rating Project will dovetail nicely with these efforts by drawing attention to articles that are most in need of revision and improvement, and by making concrete suggestions about those articles (recommended readings, misconceptions, etc.).
